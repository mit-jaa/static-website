### Dear President Kornbluth and UA leadership,

We are writing to express our concern about the following referendum to be voted on for adoption by the [Undergraduate Association on March 18th-22nd, 2024](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cjLVn9WOqWhagn83xunCSA2jl3B4dTdT/view).

We find the claims as written polarizing and one-sided, aiming to further split the undergraduate community and create a hostile environment for Jewish and Israeli students and faculty.

We urge MIT leaders to either remove this referendum or replace it with a more balanced version designed to promote a healthy collaboration and a safe learning environment for all on the MIT campus.
