### Shana Tova!

The MIT Jewish Alumni Alliance wishes all MIT Jewish students and Jewish members of our community a healthy, happy, and fulfilling New Year. We recognize 5785 presented challenges as well as opportunities. As the sun sets and the shofar sounds, may you find the courage to sail safely through this turbulence, find the strength to overcome fear, find the joy in your life, and find the the pride of being part of a wonderful Jewish community.

\- MITJAA Executive Committee
