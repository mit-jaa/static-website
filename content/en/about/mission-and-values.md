We are dedicated members of the MIT community, spanning generations of alumni and supporters. We are grateful to our non-Jewish allies who stand with us. Our aim is to eliminate antisemitism within the MIT community and to ensure that the MIT leadership and administration establish concrete and effective measures to support this mission.
