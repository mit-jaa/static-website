<h2><a href="/open-letters/2025-03-19/">Open Letter regarding MIT’s funding and sanctioning of campus antisemitism</a></h2>
<h5>March 19, 2025</h5>
<p>We, the undersigned members and supporters of the MIT Jewish Alumni Alliance, are keenly aware of your recent attention to the impact that initiation of Federal penalties will have on universities that continue to engage in civil rights violations. Your address of March 4th to the MIT community focused primarily on the threat to money streams and to cash flow to MIT, while also announcing a hiring freeze.

<p>We would like to thank you for condemning the actions targeting Professor Daniela Rus and her laboratory and we hope that those responsible will be promptly identified and appropriately disciplined. We must, however, point out that the egregious actions targeting Professor Rus have been enabled by the pervasive and hostile atmosphere of antisemitism and harassment of Jews that has been allowed to flourish on the MIT campus, with a noticeable acceleration since October 7, 2023. This poisonous atmosphere persists because MIT leadership and administrators have been unable or unwilling to take actions necessary to squarely address and decisively eliminate this antisemitic scourge.</p>
