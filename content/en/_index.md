<h3><a href="/other-actions/einat-wilf-webinar/">Dr. Einat Wilf: Antisemitism in Higher Education: Unmasking the Lie of Anti-Zionism</a></h3>

**Dear Supporter,**

Thank you for joining us for our webinar, Antisemitism in Higher Education: Unmasking the Lie of Anti-Zionism, held June 18, 2025. We were honored to host this important conversation.

Our distinguished speaker, Dr. Einat Wilf, shared her powerful insights on antisemitism, the use of prestigious institutions to legitimize and reinforce anti-Jewish libels, and the targeting of Israel as the existential battle against the collective Jew.

If you missed the live event or want to revisit the discussion, you can access the full recording above.

We hope you found the conversation both enlightening and motivating. We encourage you to share this recording with your colleagues and friends.

If you have any questions or feedback, please don’t hesitate to reach out to us at:

Thank you once again for your participation. We look forward to continuing the conversation with you.

With Warm regards,

Executive Committee\

### Statement from MIT JAA regarding MIT 2025 graduation ceremony

##### Posted May 30, 2025

Yesterday, during the MIT 2025 graduation, a student speaker wrapped in a keffiyeh took the opportunity to hijack the ceremony and to dedicate the entirety of her speech to berating and defaming Israel and promoting Hamas-inspired propaganda.  One attendee, who travelled from Israel with his family to receive his Ph.D. diploma, commented that his children were distraught over the speech, and he needed to explain to them why a random person half-way across the world hates them.

This is not what a graduation ceremony is meant to be.  A graduation ceremony is meant to honor its graduates and their accomplishments.

MIT JAA is profoundly disappointed in the MIT leadership and administration who failed to prevent a rogue student from taking over yesterday’s graduation ceremony that was meant to celebrate the achievements of its student body.

MIT JAA is also profoundly disappointed in President Sally Kornbluth, who, speaking immediately after the student speaker, failed to address or acknowledge what had transpired.

We expect MIT to take immediate disciplinary action against this student speaker.

<h2><a href="/open-letters/2025-03-19/">Open Letter regarding MIT’s funding and sanctioning of campus antisemitism</a></h2>
<h5>March 19, 2025</h5>
<p>We, the undersigned members and supporters of the MIT Jewish Alumni Alliance, are keenly aware of your recent attention to the impact that initiation of Federal penalties will have on universities that continue to engage in civil rights violations. Your address of March 4th to the MIT community focused primarily on the threat to money streams and to cash flow to MIT, while also announcing a hiring freeze. A significant driver of current Federal hostility toward institutions of higher education, including MIT, results from the sponsoring by these institutions, of events that champion hate speech against Jews which serve to foster and worsen an environment already threatening to the Jewish community. The position of the Federal government on …</p>

<h2><a href="/open-letters/2024-12-10/">Open Letter about a professor harassed on campus</a></h2>
<h5>December 10, 2024</h5>
<p>We would like to thank you for condemning the actions targeting Professor Daniela Rus and her laboratory and we hope that those responsible will be promptly identified and appropriately disciplined. We must, however, point out that the egregious actions targeting Professor Rus have been enabled by the pervasive and hostile atmosphere of antisemitism and harassment of Jews that has been allowed to flourish on the MIT campus, with a noticeable acceleration since October 7, 2023. This poisonous atmosphere persists because MIT leadership and administrators have been unable or unwilling to take actions necessary to squarely address and decisively eliminate this antisemitic scourge.</p>
